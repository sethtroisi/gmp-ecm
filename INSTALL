Instructions to install GMP-ECM:

0) you first need to install the GNU MP (GMP) library.
   GNU MP is available from <http://www.swox.com/gmp/>.

   Remark: GNU MP is already installed in most Linux distributions.
   However it is often an old version, moreover without processor-specific
   optimizations. If you care about efficiency, be sure to install the
   latest version of GNU MP (4.2 as of March 2006), and to compile it
   for your particular processor.

1) check your configuration with:

   $ ./configure

   The configure script accepts several options (see ./configure --help).
   In particular you can specify the GMP installation directory with:

   $ ./configure --with-gmp=<gmpdir>

   where <gmpdir>/include contains the header file gmp.h, and <gmpdir>/lib
   contains the static or dynamic libraries (libgmp.a, libgmp.so, libgmp.lib).
 
   Note: the configure script will first search for a static GMP library, which
   makes GMP-ECM more efficient. When only a dynamic library is available, make
   sure to correctly set your dynamic libraries search path (LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   on Unix systems), otherwise the configure script may fail.

   Warning: it is recommended to use the same compiler and options as those
   used to compile GMP, otherwise the compilation may fail, or you may get
   poor performance. In the GMP build directory, simply type:

   $ egrep -w '(CC|CFLAGS)' config.log

   to see which compiler and options were used to build GMP. For example
   on a Sparc v9 you may have to type:
   
   $ ./configure CC=cc CFLAGS="-fast -fns=no -fsimple=1 -xarch=v9" 
   
   Note 2: If you want to use George Woltman's GWNUM library for speeding up
   factoring Fermat numbers, obtain the file "gwnum_gpl_linux.tgz" from
   ftp://mersenne.org/gimps/ (or gwnum_gpl.zip or gwnum_gpl_mingw.tgz
   accordingly) and follow the instructions therein to compile
   the library. Possibly the archive contains a readily compiled library
   "gwnum.a" or "gwnum.lib". Then use

   $ ./configure --with-gwnum=<gwnum directory>

   The directory must include the gwnum.a or gwnum.lib file as well as 
   gwnum.h and related header files. The source file of the gwnum library
   is available at <http://www.mersenne.org/source.htm>.

2) compile the program with:

   $ make

   This will create the 'libecm.a' library, the 'ecm' binary file,
   the 'ecmfactor' binary file (sample use of libecm.a), and 'tune',
   a tuning program.

3) to check that the program works correctly, type:

   $ make check

   This will run several tests for P+1, P-1, ECM. These tests take a few
   minutes. It should normally end with "All ECM tests are ok."

4) (optional) to tune GMP-ECM, simply type:

   $ make ecm-params; make

   See also README ("How to get the best of GMP-ECM?"). Note: if your machine
   has not enough memory for the tune program, you can run it manually with
   ./tune -max_log2_len 16 for example (the default is 18).

5) (optional) you can then install the ecm binary and its man page:

   $ make install

   By default, installation will be done in /usr/local.
   You can change with the --prefix option of configure at step 1:
   
   $ ./configure --prefix=<my_installation_directory>

   The ecm binary will go in <my_installation_directory>/bin,
   its man page in <my_installation_directory>/man/man1,
   the ecm library in <my_installation_directory>/lib,
   and the corresponding header file in <my_installation_directory>/include.

   You can also do "make uninstall" to remove those files.

6) If you like GMP-ECM, please help us factoring Cunningham numbers. First
   download "cunningham.in" on <http://www.loria.fr/~zimmerma/ecmnet/>, then
   perform one ecm test with B1=43e6 on each number of this file:

   $ ./ecm 43e6 < cunningham.in > cunningham.out &

   If you find any factor (grep found cunningham.out), please submit it
   using the report form on <http://www.loria.fr/~zimmerma/ecmnet/>.

============================================================================

For Windows users:

Before you can compile GMP-ECM, you will need a compiler. Several suitable
compilers are freely available, for example as part of MinGW, CygWin and 
Microsoft's Services for Unix (SFU). We recommend MinGW as it is a smaller 
download than the others and generates binaries that run on any Windows 
system, even if they don't have MinGW installed themselves.

Step-by-step instructions, courtesy of Jes Hansen:

1) Download the current MinGW from
   http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/MinGW-3.1.0-1.exe?download
   and MSYS from http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.10.exe?download

2) Create a folder, for example C:\GNU, and install MinGW (execute the 
   MinGW-3.1.0-1.exe file) into C:\GNU\MinGW

3) Install MSYS (execute the MSYS-1.0.10.exe file) into C:\GNU\msys
   Now you get an icon on the desktop where you can start the MinSys. Do
   this, because is creates your home folder. Then exit it again.

4) Download the latest version of GMP (at the time of writing the latest 
   version is 4.2, this will be assumed for the rest of this document) 
   in .tar.gz format from http://www.swox.com/gmp/ and place it in your 
   newly created home folder. The home folder is in C:\GNU\msys\home and 
   has the same name as your Windows login name.

5) Download GMP-ECM (if you do not have it already) from
   http://www.loria.fr/~zimmerma/records/ecmnet.html (check the News section
   for the latest release, at the time of writing 6.1) and place it in your
   home folder as well. You won't need an internet connection from now on, 
   feel free to disconnect.

6) Start the MinSys up again from the desktop and type 
   tar -xvzf gmp-4.2.tar.gz
   cd gmp-4.2/
   ./configure
   make install
   cd ~

7) You are back in your home directory. Now type
  tar -xvzf ecm-6.1.tar.gz
  cd ecm-6.1
  ./configure --with-gmp=/usr/local
  make

8) Four executables should have appeared. The main application is ecm.exe,
   which can be run from the Windows command line.

============================================================================

In case of a problem, report it to us, with:

- the output of the config.log file

- the versions of GMP-ECM and GMP used (first output line), for example:
  
  GMP-ECM 6.1 [powered by GMP 4.2] [P+1]

  $ echo 328006342451 | ./ecm -pp1 -x0 5 120 7043

- the output you get.

Then send your bug report at <ecm-discuss@lists.gforge.inria.fr>.
