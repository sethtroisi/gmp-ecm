1) efficiency/memory
- the "Reducing  G * H" step can be improved as follows: first compute
  D = GH*I mod (x^d+1) where d = deg(F), and I = 1/F mod (x^d+1); then
  compute E = D*F mod (x^d-1); finally compute T = (GH-E)/2 mod (x^d+1).
  T equals the Montgomery product GH/(x^d+1) mod F.
  See the paper "Fast convolution meets Montgomery" by Preda Mihailescu
  (Mathematics of Computation).
- regression in stage 2 between 6.0.1 and 6.1.1:
  echo "(2003663613*2^195000-2)/(2*23*173*3863)" | ecm -c 25 3000
  (on Opteron, stage 2 takes 55279ms with 6.0.1, and 1410350ms with 6.1.1)
  This seems to be due to the default -ntt, which might require too many
  primes in that case. Maybe revert to -no-ntt by default, or when the input
  number is larger than some bound.
- slowdown in stage 1 with REDC between a 58672-digit number and a
  58688-digit number [reported by Christophe.CLAVIER@gemalto.com, 29 Aug 2007]
  (((2003663613*2^195000-2)/(2*23*173*3863))/1954173900202379)/3612632846010637
  ((2003663613*2^195000-2)/(2*23*173*3863))/1954173900202379
  with B1=1000 on an Opteron (44.2s for c58672, 67.5s for c58688).
  The culprit seems to be the REDC routine in mpmod.c: indeed, in case the 
  modulus has n limbs, but the most significant one has only a few bits,
  the product (called x in REDC) has only 2n-1 limbs, and we never call
  Mulders's short product in ecm_redc_n (however the else-code using full
  products seem faster in that case).
  For c58672, if one replaces if (xn == 2 * n) in mpmod.c/REDC by
  if (xn >= 2 * n - 1), the time of stage 1 grows from 44s to 64s, whereas
  ecm_redc_n should be faster...
- in Brent-Suyama's extension, the evaluation of a polynomial of degree k
  over N consecutive values is currently done using a O(k N) algorithm
  [table of differences]. One can do O(N/k M(k)), cf Section 3 from 
  "Linear recurrences with polynomial coefficients and application to
   integer factorization and Cartier-Manin operator", by Alin Bostan,
   Pierrick Gaudry and Eric Schost, SIAM journal on computing, 
   vol. 36, no. 6, pp. 1777 - 1806, 2007.
   It is not clear if this result also applies to ECM, but at least it
   should word for P-1 and P+1.
- why restrict the use of mpn_mul_fft to Fermat numbers? We could use it
  for any cofactor of 2^(n*BITS_PER_MP_LIMB)+1, as long as
  mpn_fft_next_size (n, mpn_fft_best_k (n, S1 == S2)) == n.
- use mpres in step 2 (Target: 7.0)
- write a mpn version of add3 and duplicate  
- take relative speed of multiplying/squaring into account in PRAC
  (DN: couldn't get any significant speed increase)
- use/implement a mpn_mul_hi_n routine for use in mpn_REDC
- use mpn_addmul_2, mpn_addmul_4 in the basecase REDC [for machines
  where it exists]. ASM code should perhaps be moved into GMP.
- try McLaughlin's algorithm for Montgomery's modular multiplication
  (http://www.ams.org/mcom/0000-000-00/S0025-5718-03-01543-6/home.html)
- consider Colin Percival's generalized DWT for multiplication modulo
  k*a^n+b, where k*a*b is highly composite. May belong to GMP rather than
  GMP-ECM.
- implement assembly code (redc.asm) for other architectures
- allow composite d2 (Target: perhaps 6.1? Postponed.)
- init mpz_t's with correct amount of memory allocated to avoid reallocs.
  Check for reallocs with GMP's memory interface routines. 
  (Target: 6.1? 7.0? Partly done.)
- try sliding window multipliation for ECM stage 1 (Target: 7.0)
- choose Brent/Suyama polynomial according to B2/k and not B2!
- Adjust estimated memory to take into account -treefile and NTT (Target: 6.1)
  (done but improvement possible)
- when GWNUM is used, lower the default B2 (James Wanless, 17 Mar 2006,
	james at grok.ltd.uk)
- implement enhanced standard continuation? With graph cover algorithm?
- parallel/distributed stage 2?
- add curve selection for torsion group of order 8 or 16, see Montgomery's
  thesis. (request of Peter-Lawrence Montgomery)

2) interface
- with -resume, print %time for THIS RUN instead of total run?
	[suggested by SleepHound <sleephound@yahoo.com>]
  Add CPUTIME=... in the save file, to take into account the total cpu time
  spend so far (in seconds). George Woltman agrees for that change. It won't
  hurt prime95/mprime -> will be added for his next version.
- when resuming, print the *initial* x0 for P-1/P+1?
- [from Jakub Pawlewicz <pan@mimuw.edu.pl>] add an option -stage1time t
  to tell the step 1 time, when done by another program. PZ: or better
  have it in resume file? (Target: 6.1. Command line option done)
- add proper file locking for save files, so several processes can safely
  write to the same file.

3) documentation
- add examples for typical use to README 
  (see http://www.mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?t=3922)

4) installation
- add a configure option --enable-shared --disable-static to link GMP
  dynamically
- [suggested by Peter Montgomery] add the possibility to compile a "fat"
  binary, which automatically selects the best mulredc assembly code
  depending on the cpuid [see TODO.fat]

5) bugs
- F15: B1=99000, B2=150577181, sigma=3039152787 with ecm-6.0.1 [Bruce]
  finds the input number. Seems to be fixed in r846, by the 3 changes
  _mpz_realloc -> MPZ_REALLOC in mpmod.c.
- potential bug: _mpz_realloc changes the value to 0 when it does not fit
	(mpmod.c)
- "not enough primes in interval" with NTT for large numbers (e.g. F17
  with B1=3000000, B2=11414255590)
- ecm -v 1e6 3-2 < c155 prints wrong expected number of curves (should be
  the same as ecm -v 1e6 2). Reported by Peter Montgomery, 30 Mar 2006.

6) others
- produce dynamic binary/library with --enable-shared
  [reported by Thomas M.Ott, thmo-13@gmx.de, 25 Oct 2005]
- from Dan Bernstein <djb@cr.yp.to> 7 Mar 2006: use the curve
  (16b+18)y^2 = x^3 + (4b+2)x^2 + x with starting point (x=2,y=1).
  Caveat: with Montgomery multiplication, even if b is small (the argument
  used in duplicate), we still have to divide by R^l. Workaround: replace
  the mpres_mul call by a mpres_mul_ui call (b is not transformed).
- add primality proving of factors/cofactors? Maybe link Pari for this?
- add point counting algorithm? SEA implementation exists for Pari/GP,
   use that?
- let user specify previous factoring work, compute distribution of
  candidate factors, compute probability of/est. time to finding a factor 
  with given parameters.
- re-write in C++? Lots of work, but would make parts of the code much
  cleaner.
