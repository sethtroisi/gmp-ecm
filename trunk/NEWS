Changes between ecm-6.0 and ecm-6.0.1

* now checks for availability of snprintf() during configure
* fixed linking problems with tune and tune2 on PowerPC G5
* fixed segfault in rho.c
* fixed main()'s B2 value being overwritten by callees
* allow both \r and \n for newline (for Apple computers)
* made files compile under Visual C
* fixed bug in listz.c that could leave undefined data
* fixed the -B2scale option
* fixed small error in printed B2' value (with -v)
* added Windows section to INSTALL
* small corrections to ecm.xml and ecm.1
* added curve counter in loop mode again
* fixed segfault when a non-number was in place of B2 on command line
* worked around problem with MinGW/Wine scanf() (value 1 too high for %n)
* free rhotable memory at end of stage 2
* replaced GSL's dilog_series() in rho.c due to licensing (GPL vs. LGPL)

Changes between ecm-5.0.3 and ecm-6.0:

* use of the autotools (configure/make)	
* there is now a documentation in "man" format (ecm.1)
* added a set of -prp* command line switches which will use an external
    program to perform prp testing of candidate and factors.  When the
	numbers get large, GMP becomes very non-optimal in PRP testing.
	An external program, such as OpenPFGW, can be much faster than
	the GMP.  (New code from Phil Carmody)
* new parser for symbolic input
* added hex number input into the expression parser.  This was needed 
    due to save files from Prime95 being output in hex.  ecm was not
    resuming these.
* added some porting code so ecm builds under VC6.  VC6 builds an ecm
    that is is about 1% to 3% faster than the MinGW build (which is
    about 1% to 3% faster than a Cygwin build)
* quiet mode (-q) now prints on stdout all factors found on the same line:
  f1 f2 ... fk ccc
  where ccc is the remaining composite (contributed by Laurent Fousse).
  Example:
  $ echo 438573459834757 | ./ecm -sigma 6 -q 1e2
  2166151 202466707
* special code for Fermat numbers, which improves both steps, example for F12:
  GMP-ECM 5.0.3 [powered by GMP 4.1.4] [ECM]
  Input number has 1187 digits
  Using B1=100000, B2=31565866, polynomial x^2, sigma=4155936925
  Step 1 took 27157ms
  Step 2 took 20830ms
  GMP-ECM 5.2.0 [powered by GMP 4.1.4] [ECM]
  Input number has 1187 digits
  Using B1=100000, B2=31565866, polynomial x^2, sigma=535125396
  Step 1 took 24264ms
  Step 2 took 6605ms
* speed improvement in step 2, especially for large B2 (here with the c155
  in the GMP-ECM sources), using Kronecker/Schonhage multiplication:
  GMP-ECM 5.0.3 [powered by GMP 4.1.4] [ECM]
  Using B1=3000000, B2=4016636514, polynomial Dickson(12), sigma=2383768044
  Step 1 took 62305ms
  Step 2 took 45322ms
  GMP-ECM 5.2.0 [powered by GMP 4.1.4] [ECM]
  Using B1=3000000, B2=4016636514, polynomial Dickson(12), sigma=3595368442
  Step 1 took 61824ms
  Step 2 took 32989ms
* Brent-Suyama's extension now works for P+1 too	
* trial division is available (option -t n)
* new options -n (low priority) and -nn (idle priority)
* the looping mode (-c n) now continues to try to factor the composite when
  a factor is found (use -one to stop)
* new option -ve n to display only inputs of <= n characters (looping mode)
* new option -treefile which stores product tree of F on disk to save memory
* generation of roots use double sieve idea, increases B2 for given k, dF
* generation of roots for ECM rewritten to reduce number of extgcds

Changes between ecm-5.0 and ecm-5.0.1:

* fixed bug when B1 or B2min is too large, and an overflow occurs in step 2,
	making the computations incorrect. The new limit for B1 or B2min is
	now around 2^53, and an error occurs when this limit is passed.
* fixed problem with save lines incorrectly written when both sigma and A
	are given with -save.
* fixed efficiency problem with -pm1: for B1 > 1e6, use -redc or -mpz_mod
	by default.
