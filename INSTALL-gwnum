Instructions to link with George Woltman's gwnum.a library.

Note that gwnum is only used for Stage 1 of ECM. Stage 2
is not affected.

Users should familiarize themselves with the instructions in
"INSTALL-ecm" before attempting the procedures here.

0) Download Prime 95 source files. As of March 2024, the current release is:

   https://www.mersenne.org/download/software/v30/30.19/p95v3019b13.source.zip
   
   Check links appended to "https://www.mersenne.org/download/software/" for
   future Prime 95 releases.
 
   Note: due to critical bug fixes in the gwnum/ecmstag1.c and FFT
   assembly files used by GMP-ECM, versions of P95 before v3019b12
   will not work here (make check will fail) and should not be used.
   
   Unzip/extract the P95 file to any convenient location.

1) Build gwnum.a. Navigate to the directory <P95 parent folder>/gwnum.
   Follow the instructions for your machine/OS in the readme.txt file.
   For example, on 64-bit linux systems the command to execute is
   "$ make -f make64".
   
2) Configure and build with the gwnum.a library. Navigate back to the ECM build
   directory. If you have previously configured and built ECM, execute the
   command

   $ make clean

   Now execute the command

   $ ./configure --with-gwnum=<gwnum directory>

   The directory must include the gwnum.a file as well as gwnum.h and
   related header files.

   For example, if the ECM and p95 folders are both in the same home folder,
   the command might look like

   $ ./configure --with-gwnum=../p95v3019b13.source/gwnum
   
   Note that you may also need to specify "--with-gmp=<gmpdir>" if
   "configure" has trouble finding GMP.

   The line "configure: Linking with George Woltman's GWNUM" should appear
   near the end of the configure output.

3) compile the program with:
   
   $ make

4) To check that the program works correctly, type:

   $ make check

   This will run several tests for P+1, P-1, ECM, & ECM with gwnum. These
   tests take a few minutes. It should normally end with the "TOTAL" count
   equal to the "PASS" count, with the remaining counts all zero.
   
5) Usage. ECM with gwnum now has full capability to help find factors for integers
   of any form. Prior to this release gwnum was limited to processing input
   integers of the form "(k*b^n+c)/(factors, if any)". This is still the
   preferred form, if possible, since gwnum is optimized for such input.
   
   Note that to use gwnum, input numbers must be greater than 2^350,
   regardless of form.

   (1) When the "k*b^n+c" form is used, the 'k*' term is not required if k = 1.
       The exponent 'n' may be entered as an integer or in the form (b2^n2),
       with 'n' or '(b2^n2)' < 10^10. Also, k must be a positive integer with
       1 <= k < 2^53, and c must be a non-zero integer with |c| < 2^23.
       Note that the k upper limit of 2^53-1 is taken from the file
       p95v3019b13.source/gwnum/gwnum.c, line 2181:
       "if (k > 9007199254740991.0) return (GWERROR_K_TOO_LARGE);"
       and is subject to change by Woltman.
   (2) For integer-character-only input strings N, GMP-ECM may detect if
       N = k*b^n+c, and find k, b, n, and c, but if possible the "k*b^n+c"
       form should be used.
   (3) Special note: the kbnc form should be used even if we are only interested
       in a part of it. For example, suppose we wish to attempt to factor
       the Cunningham number 2,4882M = 2^2441+2^1221+1, which has 5 as a factor.
       We could enter it as "(2^2441+2^1221+1)/5" on the command line, and the
       gwnum generic code would be used. But stage 1 will actually be faster
       if we enter it as "(2^4882+1)/(5*(2^2441-2^1221+1))", since gwnum will
       use the kbnc form 2^4882+1. Here is some sample output to illustrate:
       
$ echo "(2^2441+2^1221+1)/5" | ./ecm -sigma 0:8796261600422429213 -go 11685787 12e5 33e6

       In contrast, the same input but with "-force-no-gwnum" in the command line had
       the following timings:

Using Lucas chain codes
Step 1 took 22331ms
Step 2 took 525ms

   (4) Since the gwnum routines use classical Montgomery curves of the form
       By^2 = x^3 + Ax^2 + x, "-param 0" or "-sigma 0:<val>" should always be
       specified on the command line. Note that -param may default to 1 if
       "-param" is unspecified, in which case the gwnum routines will not be
       used. The message "Using gwnum_ecmStage1(k, b, n, c, B1, gw_B1done)"
       or the message "Using gwnum_ecmStage1_generic(B1, gw_B1done)" (with
       parameters replaced by actual values) will be output at the start
       of stage 1 whenever one of the gwnum routines is used. If one of these
       messages is expected but doesn't appear, repeat the test with "-v"
       (verbose) in the command line to discover the reason.

6) Thresholds. The file "ecm-impl.h" now includes estimates of the input
   bit sizes above which gwnum will be used:
   
   #define GWNUM_KBNC_THRESHOLD 1130 /* bits */
   #define GWNUM_SPEC_DIV_THRESHOLD 1215 /* bits */
   #define GWNUM_GENERIC_THRESHOLD 2100 /* bits */

   The "SPEC_DIV" threshold is specific to inputs of the form 2^n+/-1,
   for which ECM uses "special division" for reduction.
   
   Since we currently have no tuning capability for these, and the thresholds
   may vary considerably from machine to machine, we now have two new command
   line invocations which the user may use to control gwnum usage for any
   particular test:
   
     "-force-gwnum" - override the thresholds in ecm-impl.h and require gwnum
     routines to be used for any input number greater than 2^350, which is the
     gwnum.a library threshold.
     
     "-force-no-gwnum" - gwnum routines will not be used.
     
   Use of these switches allows any user to estimate thresholds on
   their machine, edit "ecm-impl.h" accordingly, and rebuild.

7) Speedups. Depending on input number size relative to the thresholds,
   stage 1 timing comparisons with & without gwnum can range from a few
   percent near the threshold to factors of 10 and beyond for larger
   inputs. Here are two runs, the first without gwnum, and the next with gwnum,
   for the generalized Fermat number 6^2048+1:

$ echo "(6^(2^11)+1)/(96479889653761)" | ./ecm -force-no-gwnum -sigma 0:6685190033435505716 21e6 9e9

   As is easily seen, (no gwnum stage 1 time)/(gwnum stage 1 time) = 8.93 (!)
