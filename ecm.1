.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
ecm is an integer factoring program using the Elliptic Curve Method (ECM), the P\-1 method, or the P+1 method\&. The following sections describe parameters relevant to these algorithms\&.

.SH "STEP 1 AND STEP 2 BOUND PARAMETERS"

.TP
\fI\fIB1\fR\fR
\fIB1\fR is the step 1 bound\&. It is a mandatory parameter\&. It can be given either in integer format (for example 3000000) or in floating\-point format (3000000\&.0 or 3e6)\&. The largest possible \fIB1\fR value is 9007199254740996 for P\-1, ULONG_MAX for ECM and P+1\&. All primes 2 <= p <= \fIB1\fR are processed in step 1\&.

.TP
\fI\fIB2\fR\fR
\fIB2\fR is the step 2 bound\&. It is optional: if omitted, a default value is computed from \fIB1\fR, which should be close to optimal\&. Like \fIB1\fR, it can be given either in integer or in floating\-point format\&. The largest possible value of \fIB2\fR is approximately 9e23, but depends on the number of blocks \fIk\fR if you specify the \fB\-k\fR option\&. All primes \fIB1\fR <= p <= \fIB2\fR are processed in step 2\&. If \fIB2\fR < \fIB1\fR, no step 2 is performed\&.

.TP
\fI\fIB2min\fR\-\fIB2max\fR\fR
alternatively one may use the \fIB2min\fR\-\fIB2max\fR form, which means that all primes \fIB2min\fR <= p <= \fIB2max\fR should be processed\&. Thus specifying \fIB2\fR only corresponds to \fIB1\fR\-\fIB2\fR\&. The values of \fIB2min\fR and \fIB2max\fR may be arbitrarily large, but their difference must not exceed approximately 9e23, subject to the number of blocks \fIk\fR\&.

.SH "FACTORING METHOD"

.TP
\fB\-pm1\fR
Perform P\-1 instead of the default method (ECM)\&.

.TP
\fB\-pp1\fR
Perform P+1 instead of the default method (ECM)\&.

.TP
\fB\-t \fIn\fR\fR
Perform trial division up to \fIn\fR, before P\-1, P+1 or ECM\&. In loop mode (see option \fB\-c\fR), trial division is only performed in the first run\&.

.SH "GROUP AND INITIAL POINT PARAMETERS"

.TP
\fB\-x0 \fIx\fR\fR
[ECM, P\-1, P+1] Use \fIx\fR (arbitrary\-precision integer or rational) as initial point\&. For example, \fB\-x0 1/3\fR is valid\&. If not given, \fIx\fR is generated from the sigma value for ECM, or at random for P\-1 and P+1\&.

.TP
\fB\-sigma \fIs\fR\fR
[ECM] Use \fIs\fR (arbitrary\-precision integer) as curve generator\&. If omitted, \fIs\fR is generated at random\&.

.TP
\fB\-A \fIa\fR\fR
[ECM] Use \fIa\fR (arbitrary\-precision integer) as curve parameter\&. If omitted, is it generated from the sigma value\&.

.TP
\fB\-go \fIval\fR\fR
[ECM, P\-1, P+1] Multiply the initial point by \fIval\fR, which can any valid expression, possibly containing the special character N as place holder for the current input number\&. Example: 

.nf
ecm \-pp1 \-go "N^2\-1" 1e6 < composite2000
.fi
 

.SH "STEP 2 PARAMETERS"

.TP
\fB\-k \fIk\fR\fR
[ECM, P\-1, P+1] Perform \fIk\fR blocks in step 2\&. For a given \fIB2\fR value, increasing \fIk\fR decreases the memory usage of step 2, at the expense of more cpu time\&.

.TP
\fB\-treefile \fIfile\fR\fR
Stores some tables of data in disk files to reduce the amount of memory occupied in step 2, at the expense of disk I/O\&. Data will be written to files \fIfile\fR\&.1, \fIfile\fR\&.2 etc\&.

.TP
\fB\-power \fIn\fR\fR
[ECM, P\-1] Use x^\fIn\fR for Brent\-Suyama's extension (\fB\-power 1\fR disables Brent\-Suyama's extension)\&. The default polynomial is chosen depending on the method and B2\&. For P\-1, \fIn\fR must be even\&.

.TP
\fB\-dickson \fIn\fR\fR
[ECM, P\-1] Use degree\-\fIn\fR Dickson's polynomial for Brent\-Suyama's extension\&. Like for \fB\-power\fR, \fIn\fR must be even for P\-1\&.

.TP
\fB\-maxmem \fIn\fR\fR
Use at most \fIn\fR megabytes of memory in stage 2\&.

.TP
\fB\-no\-ntt\fR
Disable the Number\-Theoretic Transform code for polynomial arithmetic and allow free choice of dF\&.

.SH "OUTPUT"

.TP
\fB\-q\fR
Quiet mode\&. Found factorizations are printed on standard output, with factors separated by white spaces, one line per input number (if no factor was found, the input number is simply copied)\&.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Verbose mode\&. More information is printed, more \fB\-v\fR options increase verbosity\&. With one \fB\-v\fR, the kind of modular multiplication used, initial x0 value, step 2 parameters and progress, and expected curves and time to find factors of different sizes for ECM are printed\&. With \fB\-v \-v\fR, the A value for ECM and residues at the end of step 1 and step 2 are printed\&. More \fB\-v\fR print internal data for debugging\&.

.TP
\fB\-timestamp\fR
Print a time stamp whenever a new input number is processed\&.

.SH "MODULAR ARITHMETIC OPTIONS"

.PP
Several algorithms are available for modular multiplication\&. The program tries to find the best one for each input; one can force a given method with the following options\&.

.TP
\fB\-mpzmod\fR
Use GMP's mpz_mod function (sub\-quadratic for large inputs, but induces some overhead for small ones)\&.

.TP
\fB\-modmuln\fR
Use Montgomery's multiplication (quadratic version)\&. Usually best method for small input\&.

.TP
\fB\-redc\fR
Use Montgomery's multiplication (sub\-quadratic version)\&. Theoretically optimal for large input\&.

.TP
\fB\-nobase2\fR
Disable special base\-2 code (which is used when the input number is a large factor of 2^n+1 or 2^n\-1, see \fB\-v\fR)\&.

.TP
\fB\-base2\fR \fIn\fR
Force use of special base\-2 code, input number must divide 2^\fIn\fR+1 if \fIn\fR > 0, or 2^|\fIn\fR|\-1 if \fIn\fR < 0\&.

.SH "FILE I/O"

.PP
The following options enable one to perform step 1 and step 2 separately, either on different machines, at different times, or using different software (in particular, George Woltman's Prime95/mprime program can produce step 1 output suitable for resuming with GMP\-ECM)\&. It can also be useful to split step 2 into several runs, using the \fIB2min\-B2max\fR option\&.

.TP
\fB\-inp \fIfile\fR\fR
Take input from file \fIfile\fR instead of from standard input\&.

.TP
\fB\-save \fIfile\fR\fR
Save result of step 1 in \fIfile\fR\&. If \fIfile\fR exists, an error is raised\&. Example: to perform only step 1 with \fIB1\fR=1000000 on the composite number in the file "c155" and save its result in file "foo", use 

.nf
ecm \-save foo 1e6 1 < c155
.fi
 

.TP
\fB\-savea \fIfile\fR\fR
Like \fB\-save\fR, but appends to existing files\&.

.TP
\fB\-resume \fIfile\fR\fR
Resume residues from \fIfile\fR, reads from standard input if \fIfile\fR is "\-"\&. Example: to perform step 2 following the above step 1 computation, use 

.nf
ecm \-resume foo 1e6
.fi
 

.SH "LOOP MODE"

.PP
The ``loop mode'' (option \fB\-c \fIn\fR\fR) enables one to run several curves on each input number\&. The following options control its behavior\&.

.TP
\fB\-c \fIn\fR\fR
Perform \fIn\fR runs on each input number (default is one)\&. This option is mainly useful for P+1 (for example with \fIn\fR=3) or for ECM, where \fIn\fR could be set to the expected number of curves to find a d\-digit factor with a given step 1 bound\&. This option is incompatible with \fB\-resume, \-sigma, \-x0\fR\&. Giving \fB\-c 0\fR produces an infinite loop until a factor is found\&.

.TP
\fB\-one\fR
In loop mode, stop when a factor is found; the default is to continue until the cofactor is prime or the specified number of runs are done\&.

.TP
\fB\-b\fR
Breadth\-first processing: in loop mode, run one curve for each input number, then a second curve for each one, and so on\&. This is the default mode with \fB\-inp\fR\&.

.TP
\fB\-d\fR
Depth\-first processing: in loop mode, run \fIn\fR curves for the first number, then \fIn\fR curves for the second one and so on\&. This is the default mode with standard input\&.

.TP
\fB\-ve \fIn\fR\fR
In loop mode, in the second and following runs, output only expressions that have at most \fIn\fR characters\&. Default is \fB\-ve 0\fR\&.

.TP
\fB\-i \fIn\fR\fR
In loop mode, increment \fIB1\fR by \fIn\fR after each curve\&.

.TP
\fB\-I \fIn\fR\fR
In loop mode, multiply \fIB1\fR by a factor depending on \fIn\fR after each curve\&. Default is one which should be optimal on one machine, while \fB\-I 10\fR could be used when trying to factor the same number simultaneously on 10 identical machines\&.

.SH "SHELL COMMAND EXECUTION"

.PP
These optins allow for executing shell commands to supplement functionality to GMP\-ECM\&.

.TP
\fB\-prpcmd \fIcmd\fR\fR
Execute command \fIcmd\fR to test primality if factors and cofactors instead of GMP\-ECM's own functions\&. The number to test is passed via stdin\&. An exit code of 0 is interpreted as ``probably prime'', a non\-zero exit code as ``composite''\&.

.TP
\fB\-faccmd \fIcmd\fR\fR
Executes command \fIcmd\fR whenever a factor is found by P\-1, P+1 or ECM\&. The input number, factor and cofactor are passed via stdin, each on a line\&. This could be used i\&.e\&. to automatically mail new factors: 

.nf
ecm \-faccmd 'mail \-s ``$HOSTNAME found a factor''
                me@myaddress\&.com' 11e6 < cunningham\&.in

.fi
 

.TP
\fB\-idlecmd \fIcmd\fR\fR
Executes command \fIcmd\fR before each ECM curve, P\-1 or P+1 attempt on a number is started\&. If the exit status of \fIcmd\fR is non\-zero, GMP\-ECM terminates immediately, otherwise it continues normally\&. GMP\-ECM is stopped while \fIcmd\fR runs, offering a way for letting GMP\-ECM sleep for example while the system is otherwise busy\&.

.SH "MISCELLANEOUS"

.TP
\fB\-n\fR
Run the program in ``nice'' mode (below normal priority)\&.

.TP
\fB\-nn\fR
Run the program in ``very nice'' mode (idle priority)\&.

.TP
\fB\-B2scale \fIf\fR\fR
Multiply the default step 2 bound \fIB2\fR by the floating\-point value \fIf\fR\&. Example: \fB\-B2scale 0\&.5\fR divides the default \fIB2\fR by 2\&.

.TP
\fB\-stage1time \fIn\fR\fR
Add \fIn\fR seconds to stage 1 time\&. This is useful to get correct expected time with \fI\-v\fR if part of stage 1 was done in another run\&.

.TP
\fB\-cofdec\fR
Force cofactor output in decimal (even if expressions are used)\&.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display a short description of ecm usage, parameters and command line options\&.

.SH "INPUT SYNTAX"

.PP
The input numbers can have several forms:

.PP
Raw decimal numbers like 123456789\&.

.PP
Comments can be placed in the file: everything after ``//'' is ignored, up to the end of line\&.

.PP
Line continuation\&. If a line ends with a backslash character ``\\'', it is considered to continue on the next line\&.

.PP
Common arithmetic expressions can be used\&. Example: \fI3*5+2^10\fR\&.

.PP
Factorial: example \fI53!\fR\&.

.PP
Multi\-factorial: example \fI15!3\fR means 15*12*9*6*3\&.

.PP
Primorial: example \fI11#\fR means 2*3*5*7*11\&.

.PP
Reduced primorial: example \fI17#5\fR means 5*7*11*13*17\&.

.PP
Functions: currently, the only available function is \fIPhi(x,n)\fR\&.

.SH "EXIT STATUS"

.PP
The exit status reflects the result of the last ECM curve or P\-1/P+1 attempt the program performed\&. Individual bits signify particular events, specifically:

.TP
Bit 0
0 if normal program termination, 1 if error occured

.TP
Bit 1
0 if no proper factor was found, 1 otherwise

.TP
Bit 2
0 if factor is composite, 1 if factor is a probable prime

.TP
Bit 3
0 if cofactor is composite, 1 if cofactor is a probable prime

.PP
Thus, the following exit status values may occur:

.TP
0
Normal program termination, no factor found

.TP
1
Error

.TP
2
Composite factor found, cofactor is composite

.TP
6
Probable prime factor found, cofactor is composite

.TP
8
Input number found

.TP
10
Composite factor found, cofactor is a probable prime

.TP
14
Probable prime factor found, cofactor is a probable prime
